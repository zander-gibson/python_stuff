Create a new file called something.md in versioned_dir. Add some text into this file, e.g. copy and paste in the text from this web page.

Use git status to see if Git has seen that you have added the file.

Next, use git add to add this file to Git, and use git status to check that the file is added. Finally, use git commit -a to commit your change, writing a suitable “commit message”. Once committed, use git status to check that there is nothing left to commit, and that the working directory is clean.
